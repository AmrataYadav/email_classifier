# Email filtering
Spam Classification, Machine learning, streamlit, python

{ Dataset: Downloaded a spam.csv file from kaggle which contains email data containing spam and ham mails.

{ Machine Learning: Utilized classification algorithms like Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest
to classify emails into predefined categories (e.g., spam, ham).

{ Text Preprocessing: Cleaned and tokenized email text, removed stop words, performed stemming/lemmatization, and converted text into numerical representations suitable for model training.

{ Feature Engineering: Extracted features from email content, there were two columns, one containing type of mail and other contains the content.
{ Model Building: Split data into training and testing sets, trained models on the training data, and evaluated their performance using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.

{ Algorithm used: GaussianNB(), MultinomialNB(), BernoulliNB(), SVC, Voting Classifier, Stacking Classifier

{ Web app: Used streamlit to make a user friendly web app for using our model in a easy and simple way.
